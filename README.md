# Vpython-projects

A collection of projects aimed towards utilizing vpython as a visualization tool for physics. Several of these projects are inspired by previous classical mechanics assignments of mine, and vpython makes visualizing physical systems quick and intuitive for someone with decent physics knowledge and minimal coding knowledge.

Vpython can be used from a web browser at glowscript.org, making basic visualization incredibly accessible without the need to have locally installed programs to run code. I wrore these in jupyter lab, and utilized the numpy package very minimally, so with a few small tweaks this code can be copied onto glowscript.org for use.
